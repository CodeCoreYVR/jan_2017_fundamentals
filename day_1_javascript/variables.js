// const is used when you don't want to change the var's value
const name = 'Tam';

// let is used when you expect to change the value later
let a = 10;
a = 15;

// let a = 10; let b = 5;

let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

const firstName = "Tam";
const lastName  = "Kbeili";

const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;

// rules & conventions for variable naming
// 1- always start with a lower case letter
// 2- if you have multiple words, omit spaces and capitalize the non-first words
// 3- you can't have a space in a variable name
// 4- you can have a number in the variable name if it's not the first characater
// 5- good practice: pick meaningful names to your variables
